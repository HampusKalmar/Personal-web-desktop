# Personal Web Desktop (PWD)

## Introduction

This is my personal web desktop application. It is made using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The project has three application. A tic tac toe game, a memory game and a chat application. I will give brief overview of the different components in more detail in this README.

## Overview 

The application works in the sense that memory-game, message-application and tic-tac-toe are applications that are added to the draggable window component called sub-window. The dock-application has a dependecy of the sub-window component to display the correct application when the user presses one of the three different choices on the dock. If you want to read some more about the different components, there is a README in each components directory.
